# Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE)

Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) is a community-developed standard format, which is intended to serve the needs of the broadest possible range of cyber-investigation domains, including digital forensic science, incident response, and counter-terrorism. 

CASE is defined as a profile of the [Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)](https://ucoproject.github.io/uco/). CASE leverages contextually relevant components of the UCO extending, constraining or renaming them as appropriate.

CASE is specified at a semantic level and supports various serializations. The default serialization for CASE is JSON-LD.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a foundation for broader community involvement in defining what to represent and how.
